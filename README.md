# stacksmith-ci-example [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bitnami-labs/stacksmith-ci-example.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitnami-labs/stacksmith-ci-example)

This repository contains a simple example of how you can make your [existing CI](https://github.com/bitnami/stacksmith-cli/)
tooling build cloud image (VM or docker) via Stacksmith.

This example uses Travis CI (See [real build logs here](https://travis-ci.com/bitnami-labs/stacksmith-ci-example)),
but it's trivial to adapt to any CI tool.
